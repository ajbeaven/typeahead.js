[typeahead.js][gh-page]
=======================

Inspired by [twitter.com]'s autocomplete search functionality, typeahead.js is 
a flexible JavaScript library that provides a strong foundation for building 
robust typeaheads.

The typeahead.js library is built on top of 2 components: the data component,
[dataset](#dataset), and the UI component, [typeahead](#typeahead). Datasets are 
responsible for providing suggestions for a given query. Typeaheads are 
responsible for rendering suggestions and handling DOM interactions. Both
components can be used separately, but when used together, they provided a rich
typeahead experience.

Typeahead
---------

The typeahead component is a jQuery plugin for adding typeahead functionality
to `input` elements. It deals with rendering suggestions and handling DOM
interactions. 

### Typeahead API

#### jQuery#typeahead(options, [\*sections])

Turns any `input[type="text"]` element into a typeahead. `options` is an 
options hash that's used to configure the typeahead to your liking.  For more
info about what options are available, check out the 
[Options](#typeahead-options) section. Subsequent arguments (`\*sections`), are
individual option hashes for sections. Refer to [Sections](#sections) for more 
info.

```javascript
$('.typeahead').typeahead({
  minLength: 3,
  hightlight: true,
},
{
  name: 'hanson-brothers',
  source: {
    local: ['Jeff', 'Steve', 'Jack']
  }
});
```

#### jQuery#typeahead('destroy')

Removes typeahead.js functionality and reverts the `input` element back to how 
it was before it was turned into a typeahead.

```javascript
$('.typeahead').typeahead('destroy');
```

#### jQuery#typeahead('open')

Opens the dropdown menu of typeahead. Note that being open does not mean that
the menu is visible. The menu is only visible when it is open and not empty.

```javascript
$('.typeahead').typeahead('open');
```

#### jQuery#typeahead('close')

Closes the dropdown menu of typeahead.

```javascript
$('.typeahead').typeahead('close');
```

#### jQuery#typeahead('val')

Returns the current value of the typeahead. The value is the text the user has 
entered into the `input` element.

```javascript
var myVal = $('.typeahead').typeahead('val');
```

#### jQuery#typeahead('val', val)

Sets the value of the typeahead. This should be used in place of `jQuery#val`.

```javascript
$('.typeahead').typeahead('val', myVal);
```

### Typeahead Options

When initializing a typeahead, there are a number of options you can configure.

* `autoselect` – If `true`, when the dropdown menu is open and the user hits 
  enter, the top suggestion will be selected. Defaults to `false`.

* `highlight` – If `true`, when suggestions are rendered, pattern matches
  for the current query in text nodes will be wrapped in a `strong` element. 
  Defaults to `false`.

* `hint` – If `false`, the typeahead will not show a hint. Defaults to `true`.

* `minLength` – The minimum character length needed before suggestions start 
  getting renderd. Defaults to `1`.

### Sections

A typeahead is composed of one or more sections. For simple use cases, one 
section will usually suffice. If however you wanted to build something like
the search typeahead on twitter.com, you'd need multiple sections.

Sections can be configured using the following options.

* `name` – The name of the section. This will be prepened to `tt-section-` to 
  form the class name of the containging DOM element. Defaults to a random 
  number.

* `source` – The backing data source for the section. Can be either a function
  with the signature `(query, cb)` or a 
  [dataset options hash](#dataset-options). If the former, it is expected `cb` 
  will be invoked with an array of [datums](#datums) that are a match for 
  `query`. If the latter, a dataset will be constructed and initialized and 
  that will be used as the backing data source. **Required**.

* `templates` – A hash of templates to be used when rendering the section.

  * `empty` – Rendered when `0` suggestions are available for the given query. 
  Can be either a HTML string or a precompiled template. If it's a precompiled
  template, the passed in context will contain `query`.

  * `footer`– Rendered at the bottom of the section. Can be either a HTML 
  string or a precompiled template. If it's a precompiled template, the passed 
  in context will contain `query` and `isEmpty`.

  * `header` – Rendered at the top of the section. Can be either a HTML string 
  or a precompiled template. If it's a precompiled template, the passed in 
  context will contain `query` and `isEmpty`.

  * `suggestion` – Used to render a single suggestion. If set, this has to be a 
  precompiled tempate. The associated datum object will serves as the context. 
  Defaults to the value of the datum wrapped in a `p` tag.

### Custom Events

The typeahead component triggers the following custom events.

* `typeahead:opened` – Triggered when the dropdown menu of a typeahead is 
  opened.

* `typeahead:closed` – Triggered when the dropdown menu of a typeahead is 
  closed.

* `typeahead:cursorchanged` – Triggered when the dropdown menu cursor is moved
  to a different suggestion. The datum for the suggestion that the cursor was
  moved to is passed to the event handler as an argument in addition to the name 
  of the section it belongs to.

* `typeahead:selected` – Triggered when a suggestion from the dropdown menu is 
  selected. The datum for the selected suggestion is passed to the event handler 
  as an argument in addition to the name of the section it belongs to.

* `typeahead:autocompleted` – Triggered when the query is autocompleted. 
  Autocompleted means the query was changed to the hint. The datum used for 
  autocompletion is passed to the event handler as an argument in addition to 
  the name of the section it belongs to.

All custom events are triggered on the element initialized as a typeahead.

### Look and Feel

Below is a faux mustache template describing the DOM structure of a typeahead 
dropdown menu. Keep in mind that `header`, `footer`, `suggestion`, and `empty` 
come from the templates mentioned [here](#sections). 

```html
<span class="tt-dropdown-menu">
  {{#sections}}
    <div class="tt-section-{{name}}">
      {{{header}}}
      <span class="tt-suggestions">
        {{#suggestions}}
          <div class="tt-suggestion">{{{suggestion}}}</div>
        {{/suggestions}}
        {{^suggestions}}
          {{{empty}}}
        {{/suggestions}}
      </span>
      {{{footer}}}
    </div>
  {{/sections}}
</span>
```

When an end-user mouses or keys over a `.tt-suggestion`, the class `tt-cursor` 
will be added to it. You can use this class as a hook for styling the "under 
cursor" state of suggestions.

Dataset
-------

Datasets are the data component that is responsible for computing a suggestion
set for a given query. They're robust, flexible, and offer advanced 
functionality such as prefetching, intelligent caching, fast lookups, and 
backfilling with remote data.

### Dataset API

#### Constructor

The constructor function. It takes an [options hash](#dataset-options).

```javascript
var dataset = new Dataset({
  name: myDatasetName,
  local: ['dog', 'pig', 'moose'],
  remote: 'http://example.com/animals?q=%QUERY'
});
```

#### Dataset#initialize()

Kicks off the initialization of the dataset. This includes processing the data
provided through `local` and fetching and processing the data provided by 
`prefetch`. `Dataset#get` and `Dataset#add` will be useless until this method
is called.

```javascript
dataset.initialize();
```

#### Dataset#get(query, cb)

Retrieves datums from the dataset matching  `query` and invokes `cb` with 
them. `cb` will always be called at least once with the mixed results from
`local` and `prefetch`. If those results are insufficent, `cb` will be called 
again later with the mixed results from `local`, `prefetch`, **and** `remote`.

```javascript
dataset.get(myQuery, function(suggestions) {
  suggestions.each(function(suggestion) {
    console.log(suggestion.value);
  });
});
```

### Dataset Options

When initializing a dataset, there are a number of options you can configure.

* `valueKey` – The key used to access the value of the datum in the datum 
  object. Defaults to `value`.

* `limit` – The max number of suggestions to return from `Dataset#get`. If not
  reached, the dataset will attempt to backfill the suggestions from `remote`.

* `tokenizer` – A function with the signature `(str)` that returns an array of
  tokens. The default implementation of `tokenizer` splits `str` on whitespace.

* `dupChecker` – A function with the signature `(datum1, datum2)` that returns
  `true` if the datums are duplicates or `false` otherwise. If `dupChecker` is
  `true`, a function that compares value properties will be used. This is used 
  for making sure no duplicate suggestions are introduced from `remote`.

* `sorter` – A [compare function] used to sort matched datums for a given query.

* `local` – An array of [datums](#datum).

* `prefetch` – Can be a URL to a JSON file containing an array of datums or, if 
  more configurability is needed, a [prefetch options hash](#prefetch).

* `remote` – Can be a URL to fetch suggestions from when the data provided by 
  `local` and `prefetch` is insufficient or, if more configurability is needed, 
  a [remote options hash](#remote).

### Prefetch

Prefetched data is fetched and processed on initialization. If the browser 
supports local storage, the processed data will be cached there to 
prevent additional network requests on subsequent page loads.

When configuring `prefetch`, the following options are available.

* `url` – A URL to a JSON file containing an array of datums. **Required.**

* `cacheKey` – The key data will be stored in local storage under. Defaults to 
  `url`.

* `ttl` – The time (in milliseconds) the prefetched data should be cached in 
  local storage. Defaults to `86400000` (1 day).

* `thumbprint` – A string used for thumbprinting prefetched data. If this
  doesn't match what's stored in local storage, the data will be refetched.

* `filter` – A function with the signature `filter(parsedResponse)` that 
  transforms the response body into an array of datums. Expected to return an 
  array of datums.

* `ajax` – The [ajax settings object] passed to `jQuery.ajax`.

<!-- section links -->

[ajax settings object]:http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jQuery-ajax-settings

### Remote

Remote data is only used when the data provided by `local` and `prefetch` is 
insufficient. In order to prevent an obscene number of requests being made to
the remote endpoint, typeahead.js rate-limits remote requests.

When configuring `remote`, the following options are available.

* `url` – A URL to make requests to when when the data provided by `local` and 
  `prefetch` is insufficient. **Required.**

* `wildcard` – The pattern in `url` that will be replaced with the user's query 
  when a request is made. Defaults to `%QUERY`.

* `replace` – A function with the signature `replace(url, query)` that can be 
  used to override the request URL. Expected to return a valid URL. If set, no 
  wildcard substitution will be performed on `url`.

* `rateLimitBy` – The method used to rate-limit network requests. Can be either 
  `debounce` or `throttle`. Defaults to `debounce`.

* `rateLimitWait` – The time interval in milliseconds that will be used by 
  `rateLimitBy`. Defaults to `300`.

* `filter` – A function with the signature `filter(parsedResponse)` that 
  transforms the response body into an array of datums. Expected to return an 
  array of datums.

* `ajax` – The [ajax settings object] passed to `jQuery.ajax`.

<!-- section links -->

### Tokens

The algorithm used by datasets for providing suggestions for a given query is
token-based. When `Dataset#get` is called, it tokenizes `query` using 
`tokenizer` and then invokes `cb` with all of the datums that contain those 
tokens.

By default, a dataset will generate tokens for a datum by tokenizing its value.
However, it is possible to explicitly set the tokens for a datum by including a
`tokens` property.

```javascript
{
  value: 'typeahead.js'
  tokens: ['typeahead.js', 'typeahead', 'autocomlete', 'javascript'];
}
```

The above datum would be a valid suggestion for queries such as:

* `typehead`
* `typehead.js`
* `autoco`
* `javascript type`

Datum
-----

The data representation of a suggestion is referred to as a datum. A datum is
an object that can contain arbitrary properties. When a suggestion is 
rendered, its datum will be the context passed the suggestion template.

Datums are expected to contain a value property – when a suggestion is 
selected, this will be what the value of the `input` is set to. By default,
it's expected the name of this property will be `value`, but it's configurable.
See [Dataset](#dataset) for more details.

For ease of use, datums can also be represented as a string. Strings found in 
place of datum objects are implicitly converted to an object with its value
property set to the string.

Here's a datum in its simplest form.

```javascript
{
  value: "monkey"
}
```

Here's a more complex datum that would be used for a Twitter account 
typeahead. The value property here is `handle` and the datum contains additional
properties to make it possible to render richer suggestions. This datum also
explicitly sets its [tokens](#tokens).


```javascript
{
  name: 'Jake Harding',
  handle: '@JakeHarding',
  tokens: ['jake', 'harding', 'jakeharding', '@jakeharding'],
  profileImageUrl: 'https://twitter.com/JakeHaridng/path/to/img'
}
```
